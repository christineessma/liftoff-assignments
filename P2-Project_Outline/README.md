## Assignment Description

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here:
Our project is "Summer Camp Quest" which helps parents/students to explore all
available summer camps options in 'St. Louis' location in one website.
Users can view camps using price, age, category etc. & mark their favorite ones.
Admin users will add / update / delete the camp details.
Why did we get motivated? As parents we have a hard time finding the camps at
one place where we lose track of the camps, and it is a time-consuming process. We
came up with an idea to create a website that would be helpful for parents as well
as high school students.
